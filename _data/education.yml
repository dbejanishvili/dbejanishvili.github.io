    During my time at Free University I learnt most of my key skills that I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. The road to becoming a bachelor was tough, but I'm glad I had the opportunity to study at the best university in Georgia.

    Applying to "Vekua" (as they call N42 school in Georgia) was a real turning point in my life. The atmosphere was radically different from the school i relocated from, it was organised, it was interesting and best of all, it was challenging. I learnt a lot during my time there,

    "MZIURI" is a small IT Center in Tbilisi, that also happens to be the best place to learn competitive programming in Georgia. It has best teachers and best students. The environment is super competitive and effective in doing what it does. 
    It was the primary source of programming knowledge in my early years and I'm happy to have had attended this school.
