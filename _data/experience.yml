    Op Solutions is a Georgian software company founded by me and a couple of my friends. We are working on a variety of projects, ranging from simple e-commerce to more complex fields such as machine learning and blockchain.
    Since we are a young company, most of our projects are owned by external parties, but we have some in house projects as well. 
    Starting a company from scratch is a very hard task, but thanks to our skill and dedication we seem to have found some success.

    Free university is a hub for the most skilled and smart students around Georgia, so being asked to be a lecturer's assistant was an achievement in itself. Grading other students' work was a very good exercise in code review.
    Being asked to be a seminar instructor was an even bigger deal. It was a very good exercise in lower level programming, code review, planning and organization.

    "Birtvi" was a very brief but a very welcome experience. Even though it was only a couple of months, I got an opportunity to work with one of the most exciting aspects of modern programming, blockchain. 
    There I picked up the basics of blockchain architecture, enough to be able to write simple decentralised applications, which would become very handy in the future.

    N42 Public School of Physics–Mathematics named after Ilia Vekua (along with Demireli collage) was my first try at being an educator. Along with a handful of other schools, Vekua is leading school in subjects such as maths, physics and informatics. 
    I started working there a year after graduating and continued working for 3 years. In these 3 years I helped prepare students for olympiads, likes of which I attended myself couple years ago. All and all, I think my time there was very beneficial.

    Demireli collage (along with N42 public school) was my first try at being an educator. Along with a handful of other schools, Demireli college was a leading school in subjects such as maths and informatics. 
    Sadly the school doesn't exist any more, but working there was still a valuable experience.
